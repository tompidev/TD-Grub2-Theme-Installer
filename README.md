### ⬇️ How to add Themes to the directory

Do you want to set more Themes?

I show you how can you do this.

- First download the desired theme to your PC. 
  Downloads library you find here: [GRUB Themes - KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/browse?cat=109&ord=latest) or here [GRUB Themes - Gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=109&ord=latest)
  
- Unzip the downloaded file and copy this unzipped folder into the Themes directory inside the "TD Bootloader Themes" folder.
  
- Now follow the steps of the Installation process
  

### 🗑️ How to remove Themes from the Directory

Do you want to delete an old Theme?

Just go to the Themes directory inside the "TD Bootloader Themes" folder and delete the whole folder of the not desired Theme.

### ⚙️ How the script works?

The script reads the folder names of the whole Themes directory and creates a list from it.

If you delete a folder it will be no more shown on the list.

If you added a new Theme folder the script will see and display it in the list.

When you run the script, you get this numbered list.

Enter the desired template number from the list and press Enter.

The rest of the work is done by the script.
