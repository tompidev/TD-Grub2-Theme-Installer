# Arch-Silence GRUB2 theme

My flat GRUB2 theme.

## Font

The font in the boot menu can't be changed because of GRUB.

GRUB does have a conversion tool from ttf to it's own format but this format encodes each pixel with 1 bit
which makes it completely useless since there's practically no font that is readable in such a low bit-depth.
